\chapter{\OOMMF\ eXtensible Solver}\label{sec:oxs}
The \OOMMF\ eXtensible Solver (OXS) top level architecture is shown in
\hyperrefhtml{the class diagram below}{Fig.~}{}{fig:oxsclass}.
The ``Tcl Control Script'' block represents the user interface and
associated control code, which is written in \Tcl.  The
micromagnetic problem input file is the content of the ``Problem
Specification'' block.  The input file should be a valid \MIF~2.0 file
(see the \OOMMF\ User's Guide for details on the \MIF\ file formats),
which also happens to be a valid \Tcl\ script.  The rest of the
architecture diagram represents \Cplusplus\ classes.

All interactions between the \Tcl\ script level and the core solver are
routed through the Director object.  Aside from the Director, all other
classes in this diagram are examples of \cd{Oxs\_Ext}
objects---technically, \Cplusplus\ child classes of the abstract
\cd{Oxs\_Ext} class.  OXS is designed to be extended primarily by the
addition of new \cd{Oxs\_Ext} child classes.

The general steps involved in adding an \cd{Oxs\_Ext} child class to OXS
are:
\begin{enumerate}

\item Create a subdirectory under \fn{oommf/app/oxs/local}, and add
source code files with class definitions into this subdirectory. The
\Cplusplus\ non-header source code file(s) must be given the \cd{.cc} or
\cd{.cpp} extension.  (Header files are typically denoted with the
\cd{.h} extension, but this is not mandatory.)
\item Run \app{pimake} to compile your new code and link it in to the OXS
executable.
\item Add the appropriate \cd{Specify} blocks to your input \MIF~2.0
files.
\end{enumerate}
The source code can usually be modeled after an existing \cd{Oxs\_Ext}
object.  Refer to the Oxsii section of the \OOMMF\ User's Guide for a
description of the standard \cd{Oxs\_Ext} classes, or
\hyperrefhtml{below}{Sec.~}{}{sec:energyexample} for an annotated example of
an \cd{Oxs\_Energy} class.  Base details on adding a new energy term are
\hyperrefhtml{also presented below}{presented in Sec.~}{}{sec:energynew}.

The \app{pimake} application automatically detects all files in the
\fn{oommf/app/oxs/local} directory with the \cd{.cc} or \cd{.cpp}
extensions, and searches them for \cd{\lb include} requests to construct
a build dependency tree.  Then \app{pimake} compiles and links them
together with the rest of the OXS files into the \app{oxs} executable.
Because of the automatic file detection, no modifications are required
to any files of the standard \OOMMF\ distribution in order to add local
extensions.

Local extensions are then activated by \cd{Specify} requests in the
input \MIF~2.0 files.  The object name prefix in the \cd{Specify} block
is the same as the \Cplusplus\ class name.  All \cd{Oxs\_Ext} classes in
the standard distribution are distinguished by an \cd{Oxs\_} prefix.  It
is recommended that local extensions use a local prefix to avoid name
collisions with standard OXS objects.  (\Cplusplus\ namespaces are not
currently used in \OOMMF\ for compatibility with some older \Cplusplus\
compilers.)  The \cd{Specify} block initialization string format is
defined by the \cd{Oxs\_Ext} child class itself; therefore, as the
extension writer, you may choose any format that is convenient.
However, it is recommended that you follow the conventions laid out in
the \MIF~2.0 file format section of the \OOMMF\ User's Guide.


\section{Sample \cd{Oxs\_Energy} Class}\label{sec:energyexample}
This sections provides an extended dissection of a simple
\cd{Oxs\_Energy} child class.  The computational details are kept as
simple as possible, so the discussion can focus on the \Cplusplus\ class
structural details.  Although the calculation details will vary between
energy terms, the class structure issues discussed here apply across the
board to all energy terms.

The particular example presented here is for simulating
uniaxial magneto-crystalline energy, with a single anisotropy constant,
\cd{K1}, and a single axis, \cd{axis}, which are uniform across the
sample.

Using the templated Runge-Kutta class. Under construction.

\blackhole{
%%% Some text from an email I wrote on 4-Apr-2014:

The basic process is:

(1) Find an existing energy term that is close to what you want.  Look
    in oommf/app/oxs/ext/, oommf/app/oxs/local/, or the OOMMF page for
    contributed modules

       https://math.nist.gov/oommf/contrib/oxsext/

    You can also ask on the muMAG mailing list, or do a web search.

(2) Make a copy of the .h and .cc files of the "close" extension into
    the directory oommf/app/oxs/local/.  The new files should have a
    name different from that of the "close" extension.

(3) Select a name for your extension and change all instances of the old
    class name with the new extension name.  The name should have a
    prefix that refers to you or your institution; this is to help
    protect against name collisions with extensions written by other
    people.  All of the Oxs_Ext classes written at NIST as part of the
    OOMMF project use the prefix "Oxs_", for example Oxs_Demag,
    Oxs_UniformExchange, Oxs_UZeeman.  So do *not* use the "Oxs_" prefix
    for your extension.

(4) Do a test build with your new files.  Run 'tclsh oommf.tcl pimake'.
    Pimake will automatically notice your new .cc files in
    oommf/app/oxs/local/ and compile and link them into the oxs
    executable.  Fix any compiler and link errors as necessary until the
    build is successful.

(5) At this point you will have a working class with a new name.  You
    can write .mif files using your new class name, but the behavior
    will be the same as the "close" class.  So the next step is to edit
    the .h and .cc files to get the behavior you want:

      (a) Modify the class constructor to add or remove initialization
          parameters; these are the label-value pairs you put inside the
          class Specify block inside the .mif file.

      (b) Modify the ::GetEnergy or ::ComputeEnergy member function to
          implement the new behavior.  (GetEnergy and ComputeEnergy are
          two interfaces to the same functionality; the latter is more
          recent and is recommended for new code, but if your "close"
          class used the older GetEnergy interface then it is fine to
          stick with that.)  See the file oommf/app/oxs/base/energy.h
          for details.

(6) Run 'tclsh oommf.tcl pimake' to rebuild your extensions.  Make
    changes as necessary until it compiles and links successfully.

(7) Write a .mif file that uses your extension.  Load the problem into
    Oxsii and check that it does what you intended.

As an specific example, suppose I chose the kl_demag.h and kl_demag.cc
files as my "close" example.  So following step 2 above, I copy these
files to say kader_demag.h and kader_demag.cc.  For step 3 I open the
kader_demag.* file into a plain text editor.  Looking in the .h file I
see that the existing class name is "Klm_Demag_PBC".  So I change *all*
instances of Klm_Demag_PBC with my new class name, let's say
"Kader_Demag".  For example, in the .h file I change

 class Klm_Demag_PBC:public Oxs_Energy                    --> class Kader_Demag:public Oxs_Energy
 void (Klm_Demag_PBC::*fillcoefs)(const Oxs_Mesh*) const; --> void (Kader_Demag::*fillcoefs)(const Oxs_Mesh*) const;
 Klm_Demag_PBC(const char* name,...) // Child instance id --> Kader_Demag(const char* name,...) // Child instance id
 virtual ~Klm_Demag_PBC();                                --> virtual ~Kader_Demag();

In the .cc file I change

   OXS_EXT_REGISTER(Klm_Demag_PBC);                      --> OXS_EXT_REGISTER(Kader_Demag);
   UINT4m Klm_Demag_PBC::NextPowerOfTwo(UINT4m n) const  --> UINT4m Kader_Demag::NextPowerOfTwo(UINT4m n) const
   Klm_Demag_PBC::Klm_Demag_PBC(...)                     --> Kader_Demag::Kader_Demag(...)
   and so on...

I then do a test build with 'tclsh oommf.tcl pimake'.  If I've made all
the changes properly then it should compile and link find (step 4).  You
can now create a .mif file that includes a Specify block that looks like

   Specify Kader_Demag {
      tensor_file_name    "/tmp/demag_tensor/"
   }

It will load into Oxsii and run just like Klm_Demag_PBC.

Step 5: Edit kader_demag.h and kader_demag.cc to make the real changes
that I want.  The member function

    Kader_Demag::Kader_Demag(...)

is the constructor (step5a).  If you look in that function you will see
lines that look like

  tensor_file_name = GetStringInitValue("tensor_file_name", "");
  error_A_dip_OFFdiag = GetRealInitValue("error_A_dip_OFFdiag", 1.1e-2);

These read a parameter values named "tensor_file_name" and
"error_A_dip_OFFdiag" from the .mif Specify block.  If you don't
explicitly list these in the .mif Specify block, then the first gets a
default value of "", and the second a default value of 1.1e-2.  The
various *InitValue routines are defined in the file
oommf/app/oxs/base/ext.h and ext.cc files.  You will need to modify the
class declaration in kader_demag.h if you want to add or delete class
variables.

When you are happy with the constructor, next edit the energy
computation routine.  kl_demag uses the older GetEnergy interface ---
find the member function

    void Kader_Demag::GetEnergy

in kader_demag.cc.  Read that routine and make changes as necessary.
Then run pimake (step 6) and start testing your extension (step 7).
}
