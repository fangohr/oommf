This manual provides source code level information on \OOMMF\ (Object Oriented Micromagnetic Framework),
a public domain micromagnetics program developed at the
\htmladdnormallink{National Institute of Standards and Technology}
{https://www.nist.gov/}.  Refer to the \OOMMF\ User's Guide for an
overview of the project and end-user details.

% Hack for broken LaTeXML .xslt that typesets table of contents header
% at <h6>, which is ridiculously small. One fix is to replace the "h6"
% setting in the
%
%   <xsl:template match="ltx:TOC">
%      ...
%   </xsl:template>
%
% of oommf/doc/common/xmlextras/xslt/oommf-webpage-xhtml.xsl to
% something larger. But, we don't really need the header in the web
% version of the page, so we can drop it altogether by redefining
% \contentsname to an empty string:
 \renewcommand{\contentsname}{}
\else
 \renewcommand{\contentsname}{Table of Contents}

% Index cross-references; if these are moved to the bottom of this file
% then two LaTeX passes are required to get them in the .idx file.

% There is a strange bug in LaTeX2HTML where using multiple instances of
% the alltt environment causes LaTeX2HTML to stop interpreting a single
% blank line as a paragraph break. (Two blank lines seem to work, but
% maybe not in some cases, and anyway, yuck.) The bug appears to be
% related in some manner with \include, so one hack-around is to \input
% the file instead. A web search reports that \include differs from
% \input in that \include places \clearpage command before and after the
% included text, and also opens up a separate .aux file. I don't want to
% pander to LaTeX2HTML more than necessary (LaTeXML seems to work pretty
% well, so if the annoyance level of LaTeX2HTML gets too great we'll
% drop it), so we apply this hack only in the LaTeX2HTML processing
% case. There don't appear to be any obvious problems with this route,
% but if something turns up then checking .aux file usage might be a
% good place to start.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Bibliography and Index %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Manually add bibliography and index to the table of contents.  This
% could be done automatically using the tocbibind package, but the
% LaTeXML 0.8.6 binding for tocbibind is incomplete. We may revisit this
% if we decide we want Bibliography to be a numbered section, but
% otherwise the simplest solution probably creates the fewest
% complications across all output modalities (latex, pdflatex,
% latex2html, latexml).

% Use \phantomsection so hyperref index link in TOC point properly (otherwise
% it points to the previous section).
