The MakeRule command
</H1>
The <TT><B>makerules.tcl</B></TT> files consist primarily of a collection of
<TT>MakeRule</TT> commands surrounded by a sprinkling of Tcl support
code. The order of the <TT>MakeRule</TT> commands doesn't matter, except
that the first target in the file, usually <TT>all</TT>, becomes the default
target. (The ``default'' target is the effective target if <B>pimake</B>
is run without specifying a target.)

<P>
The <TT>MakeRule</TT> command supports a number of subcommands, but the
principle subcommand appearing in <TT><B>makerules.tcl</B></TT> files is
<TT>Define</TT>. This takes a single argument, which is a list of
option+value pairs, with valid options being <TT>-targets</TT>,
<TT>-dependencies</TT>, and <TT>-script</TT>. The value string for the
<TT>-targets</TT> option is a list of one or more build targets. The targets
are usually files, in which case they must lie in the same directory or
a directory below the <TT><B>makerules.tcl</B></TT> file. The <TT>-dependencies</TT>
option is a list of one or more files or targets that the target depends
upon. The value to the <TT>-script</TT> option is a Tcl script that is run
if a target does not exist or if any of the file dependencies have a
newer timestamp than any of the targets. The dependency checking is done
recursively, that is, each dependency is checked to see if it up to date
with its own dependencies, and so on.  A target is out of date if it is
older than any of its dependencies, or the dependencies of the
dependencies, etc. If any of the dependencies is out of date with
respect to its own dependencies, then its script will be run during the
dependency resolution. The script associated with the original target is
only run after its dependency resolution is fully completed.

<P>
The following examples from <TT><B>oommf/app/omfsh/makerules.tcl</B></TT>
should help flesh out the above description:
<PRE>
  MakeRule Define {
    -targets        [Platform Name]
    -dependencies   {}
    -script         {MakeDirectory [Platform Name]}
  }
</PRE>
Here the target is the platform name, e.g., <TT><B>windows-x86_64</B></TT>, which
is a directory under the current working directory
<TT><B>oommf/app/omfsh/</B></TT>. There are no dependencies to check, so the rule
script is run if and only if the directory <TT><B>windows-x86_64</B></TT> does not
exist. In that case the OOMMF <TT>MakeDirectory</TT> routine is called to
create it. This is an important rule because the compilation and linking
commands place their output into this directory, so it must exist before
those commands are run.

<P>
Next we look at a more complex rule that is really the bread and
butter of <TT><B>makerules.tcl</B></TT>, a rule for compiling a C++ file:
<PRE>
  MakeRule Define {
    -targets        [Platform Objects omfsh]
    -dependencies   [concat [list [Platform Name]] \
                            [[CSourceFile New _ omfsh.cc] Dependencies]]
    -script         {Platform Compile C++ -opt 1 \
                             -inc [[CSourceFile New _ omfsh.cc] DepPath] \
                             -out omfsh -src omfsh.cc
                    }
  }
</PRE>
In this example the target is the object file associated with the
stem <TT>omfsh</TT>. On Windows this would be
<TT><B>windows-x86_64/omfsh.obj</B></TT>. The dependencies are the platform
directory (e.g., <TT><B>windows-x86_64/</B></TT>), the file <TT><B>omfsh.cc</B></TT>, and any
(non-system) files included by <TT><B>omfsh.cc</B></TT>. Directory timestamps do
not affect the out-of-date computation, but directories will be
constructed by their <TT>MakeRule</TT> if they don't exist.

<P>
Note that part of the <TT>-dependencies</TT> list is
<PRE>
  [CSourceFile New _ omfsh.cc] Dependencies]
</PRE>
As discussed <A HREF="Anatomy_TT_makerules.tcl_TT.html#sec:anatomymakerules">earlier</A>,
this command resolves to a list of all non-system <TT>#include</TT> header
files from <TT><B>omfsh.cc</B></TT>, or header files found recursively from those
header files. The first part of <TT><B>omfsh.cc</B></TT> is
<PRE>
  /* FILE: omfsh.cc                 -*-Mode: c++-*-
   *
   *      A Tcl shell extended by the OOMMF core (Oc) extension
   ...
   */

  /* Header files for system libraries */
  #include &lt;cstring&gt;

  /* Header files for the OOMMF extensions */
  #include "oc.h"
  #include "nb.h"
  #include "if.h"

  /* End includes */
  ...
</PRE>
The header file <TT><B>cstring</B></TT> is ignored by the dependency search because
it is specified inside angle brackets rather than double quotes. But the
<TT><B>oc.h</B></TT>, <TT><B>nb.h</B></TT>, and <TT><B>if.h</B></TT> files are all considered. These
files are part of the <TT>Oc</TT>, <TT>Nb</TT>, and <TT>If</TT> package libraries,
respectively, living in subdirectories under <TT><B>oommf/pkg/</B></TT>. The file
<TT><B>oommf/pkg/oc/oc.h</B></TT>, for example, will be checked for included files
in the same way, and so on. The full dependency tree can be quite
extensive. The <B>pimake</B> application supports a <TT>-d</TT> option to
print out the dependency tree, e.g.,
<PRE>
  tclsh oommf.tcl pimake -cwd app/omfsh -d windows-x86_64/omfsh.obj
</PRE>
This output can be helpful is diagnosing dependency issues.

<P>
The <code>/* End includes */</code> line terminates the <TT>#include</TT> file search
inside this file. It is optional but recommended as it will speed-up
dependency resolution.

<P>
If <TT><B>omfsh.obj</B></TT> is older than any of its dependent files, then the
Tcl script specified by the <TT>-script</TT> option will be triggered. In
this case the script runs <TT>Platform Compile C++</TT>, which is the
C++ compiler as specified by the
<TT><B>oommf/config/platforms/&lt;platform&gt;.tcl</B></TT> file. In this command
<TT>-opt</TT> enables compiler optimizations, <TT>-inc</TT> supplements the
include search path for the compiler, <TT>-out omfsh</TT> is the output
object file with name adjusted appropriately for the platform, and
<TT>-src omfsh.cc</TT> specifies the C++ file to be compiled.

<P>
The rules for building executables and libraries from collections of
object modules are of a similar nature. See the various
<TT><B>makerules.tcl</B></TT> files across the OOMMF directory tree for examples.

<P>
In a normal rule, the target is a file and if the script is run it will
create or update the file. Thus, if <B>pimake</B> is run twice in
succession on the same target, the second run will not trigger the
script because the target will be up to date. In contrast, a
pseudo-target<A NAME="1122"></A> does not exist as a file on
the file system, and the associated script does not create the
pseudo-target. Since the pseudo-target never exists as a file, repeated
runs of <B>pimake</B> on the target will result in repeated runs of the
pseudo-target script.

<P>
Common pseudo-targets include <TT>all</TT>,
<TT>configure</TT>, <TT>help</TT>, and several <TT>clean</TT> variants.  This last
example illustrates the chaining of <TT>clean</TT> pseudo-targets to remove
constructed files.
<PRE>
  MakeRule Define {
    -targets         clean
    -dependencies    mostlyclean
  }

  MakeRule Define {
    -targets         mostlyclean
    -dependencies    objclean
    -script          {eval DeleteFiles [Platform Executables omfsh] \
                         [Platform Executables filtersh] \
                         [Platform Specific appindex.tcl]}
  }

  MakeRule Define {
    -targets         objclean
    -dependencies    {}
    -script          {
                      DeleteFiles [Platform Objects omfsh]
                      eval DeleteFiles \
                             [Platform Intermediate {omfsh filtersh}]
                     }
  }
</PRE>
All three of these rules have targets that are non-existent files, so
all three are pseudo-targets. The first rule, for target <TT>clean</TT>, has
no script so the script execution is a no-op. However, the dependencies
are still evaluated, which in this case means the rule for the target
<TT>mostlyclean</TT> is checked. This rule has both a dependency and a
script. The dependencies are evaluated first, so the <TT>objclean</TT>
script is called to delete the <TT>omfsh</TT> object file and also any
intermediate files created as side effects of building the <B>omfsh</B>
and <B>filtersh</B> executables. Next the <TT>mostlyclean</TT> script is run,
which deletes the <B>omfsh</B> and <B>filtersh</B> executables and also
the platform-specific <TT><B>appindex.tcl</B></TT> file. Note that none of the
scripts create their target, so the targets will all remain
pseudo-targets.
