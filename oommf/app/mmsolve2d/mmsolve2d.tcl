# Set the values of some global variables which control the
# interaction with the ThreadGui module in mmLaunch.
#
# $commands is a list which tells the interface what commands
# to display in the middle panel of "Runtime Controls".  The
# even elements of this list are labels for a row of buttons.
# Each corresponding odd element of this list is a list of
# button descriptions.  Each button description is also a list.
# The first element of a button description is the text label
# that should be displayed on the button.  The remaining elements
# are the command to be sent back to this app when the button 
# is invoked.
#
# In the following, there is one row of buttons, labeled "Solver".
# There is one button in the row, labeled "LoadProblem" and when
# that button is invoked, the command "RemoteRelayInput ProblemDescription"
# will be sent by the interface back to this app.
#

# $inputs is a list which tells the interface what data types this
# app takes as inputs.  The even elements of this list are labels
# identifying the data types.  The corresponding odd elements are
# a list which describes how to manage data of that type.  The
# first element is the name of a protocol which delivers data
# of that type.  This information is used by the interface to
# filter which threads can be selected to supply input data.
# The second element is the message within that protocol which
# requests a value of that data type.  The third element is
# the command in this app which will be completed with the
# data value returned from the source thread, and then evaluated.
# 
# For example, the following declares a single input data type,
# "ProblemDescription", for this app.  Data of that type can be
# retrieved from servers which speak the "ProbEd" protocol. 
# To get a data value, send the message "GetProbDescFile" to
# one of those servers.  Then when the server returns a value,
# evaluate the command "LoadProbDescFile $value".

# The events generated by this thread.
#
# $events is a list which tells the interface what events are
# generated within this app which the interface may schedule
# outputs for.  The even elements of this list are the names of
# the events.  Each corresponding odd element of this list is a
# list which describes the event.  The first element is a boolean
# which indicates whether the interface should display an "every"
# box for scheduling outputs against this event.  The second element
# is the name of a global variable in this app which holds a handle
# to the instance which is generating the events.  The third element
# is the method to invoke on that instance to get a count on that
# event.  
# 
# Below, two events "Iteration" and "ControlPoint" are described.
# Each supports the "every" box in the interface, and the count
# for each event is returned by [$solver GetODEStepCount] and
# [$solver GetFieldStepCount] respectively.

#	The last entry should be moved to be set by controller
#
# $outputs is a list which describes the outputs this app is
# able to send to other apps.  The even elements of this list
# are the names of the outputs.  The corresponding odd elements
# are output description lists.  The first element is the name
# of a protocol which accepts data of this type.  The second 
# element is the list of events for which the interface should
# offer to schedule output of this output type.  The third and
# fourth elements combine to describe how to get an output
# value from the objects and commands in this app.  The fifth
# element is the method within the protocol which is used to
# send the data value to the other app.
#
# For example, the Magnetization output type may be sent to other
# apps which speak the "vectorField" protocol.  The interface uses
# that information to filter which apps may be selected to receive
# Magnetization type output data.  The interface offers to schedule
# output of Magnetization data against both Iteration and ControlPoint
# events.  When it comes time to output a Magnetization data value,
# the command [$solver WriteMagFile] is evaluated and its return
# value is sent to other apps using the "datafile" message of the
# vectorField protocol.
