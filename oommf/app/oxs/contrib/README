Generic process for updating patch files for contributed packages:

1) Use the 'tclsh oommf.tcl oxspkg' command to install the package of
   interest into the oommf/app/oxs/local directory.

2) Edit the files in oommf/app/oxs/local as necessary.

3) Create a temporary holding directory, say oommf/app/oxs/contrib/foo
   and use the oxspkg copyout command to copy the package files from
   oxs/local to the holding directory.

4) Working in the oxs/contrib directory, move the copied files like so

     mv foo/my_great_package ./my_great_package-new

5) Create the new patch set, indexed with the current date

    diff -ru my_great_package my_great_package-new \
       > my_great_package-20181107.patch

   Check the patch file and make sure any files in one directory but not
   the other are handled properly.  For example, README and version date
   files are not copied out of the contrib area by oxspkg install.

6) Delete any older patch files for this package.

7) Use oommf.tcl oxspkg to uninstall the package and then re-install.
   Check that the new patch file is applied during the install.  Run
   pimake and double-check the build.
