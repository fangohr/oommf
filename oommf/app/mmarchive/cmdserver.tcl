# Command line interface for scalar and vector field servers
#
########################### PROGRAM DOCUMENTATION ###################
# This program reads commands from stdin and writes responses
# and data to stdout.  The commands are:
#
#    configure  --- Configure interface and servers.  None, one, or more
#                   options may be set within a call.  The response
#                   displays the new configuration settings.
#    connect    --- Advertise servers via account server.
#    disconnect --- Remove servers from account server advertisements.
#    peek       --- Print data in data buffer.
#    eat        --- Print data in data buffer and empty buffer.
#    exit       --- Terminate cmdserver.
#
# The configure options are:
#
#  -alias   --- Name reported (advertised) by account server.
#  -mode    --- Either "poll" or "event".  Influences data handling in
#               proc ProcessImportData.
#  -structure --- Either "white" meaning white space delimited fields
#              (default), "tcl" meaning use the Tcl list structure, or
#              "csv" indicating "Character Separated Value", with the
#              separating character given by the "csvchar" option.
#  -csvchar --- Separating value in CSV format; defaults to ",".  An
#               interesting variant is the ASCII "unit separator", aka
#               US, which has hex value 1F.  One could implement an
#               ASCII-based -structure that uses \x1F for field
#               separation and \x1E for record separation (\x1E is the
#               ASCII code for RS, "record separator).  The pro is that
#               no quoting would be necessary for text data.  The con is
#               that one couldn't use standard library calls like gets
#               to process the stdout stream, because each record would
#               be terminated by an RS character instead of a new line.
#  -datatable, -scalarfield, -vectorfield --- Which servers to activate.
#               Set to 1 to enable, 0 (default) to disable.
#
# Typical usage pattern is:
#
#   configure -scalarfield 1 -vectorfield 1 -mode poll -alias AppName
#   connect
#   eat
#  <do other stuff>
#   eat
#  <do other stuff>
#   ...
#   eat
#   disconnect
#   eat
#   exit
#
# Here "AppName" in the configure command is the advertised name for the
# enveloping application.  If -mode is set to "event" then data is
# automatically written to stdout as it arrives (from a micromagnetic
# solver).  The enveloping application should be set up to process the
# data when a readable event is raised on stdout.  In that case the
# usage pattern is:
# 
#   configure -scalarfield 1 -vectorfield 1 -mode event -alias AppName
#   connect
#   <process data as it becomes available>
#   ...
#   disconnect
#   eat
#   exit
#
# In both cases the final "eat" after the disconnect insures that any
# data arriving between the disconnect request and actual connection
# closure gets processed.
#
# If "-mode poll" is used, then the enveloping application will probably
# want to access the data in non-blocking mode, since otherwise the
# "eat" calls will hang unless and until data is sent from the
# micromagnetic solver.
#
# There are three types of records written to stdout by this cmdserver:
#
#   Command response  (R)
#   Errors            (E)
#   Data              (D)
#
# The first character in each record is one of R, E, or D as indicated
# above.  Each record ends with a new line.  There are no embedded
# new lines in any R or E records, so the first new line in those records
# indicate the end of the record.
#
# Each command written to stdin will result in exactly one R or E record
# being written to stdout.  The reply to "peek" and "eat" commands
# consists of first a record of the form
#
#    R #
#
# where "#" is an integer value indicating the number of data records;
# after the "R #" record will follow "#" data records.
#
# Each R and E record contains two fields, the first field being either
# R or E, and the second field being the response or error string.
# These fields are demarcated in the same manner as data records,
# explained below, which depends on the -structure configuration
# setting.  For example, if "-structure csv" is used with "-csvchar ,",
# then a peek command with 3 records in the buffer would have the response
#
#   R,3
#
# followed by 3 data records.
# 
# Data records, whether in response to peek/eat commands or writen
# automatically in "event" mode, have the form
#
#   D <data type> <connection id> <data fields>
#
# The method of demarcation between the various fields depends on the
# configure -structure setting.  If -structure is "white", then the
# fields are whitespace delimited.  In this case if a field contains
# embedded whitespace, then the whole field will be enclosed with double
# quotes, i.e. ", with double quotes, backslashes and new lines escaped
# with backslashes as \", \\, and \n respectively.  If the first
# character of a field is not a double quote, then the field is rendered
# literally, with no backslash escapes.
#
# If -structure is "tcl", then the record is formatted as a proper Tcl
# list, which is primarily whitespace delimited with precise rules for
# escaping special characters and sublists---see Tcl documentation for
# details.  In addition to the normal Tcl list rules, backslashes and
# new lines are represented by the two character sequences \\ and \n,
# respectively.  The latter allows for new line separated records, and
# the former is necessary to distinguish between a new line and a
# backslash followed by the letter n, as can happen in path names under
# Windows.  This escape handling is applied to all fields.
#
# If -structure is "csv", # then the fields are separated by the
# configure -csvchar character, which is typically a comma, ",".  CSV
# format does not support sublists.  If a field contains the -csvchar
# character, new lines, or double quotes, then the field will be
# surrounded with double quotes, and any double quotes inside the field
# will be replaced with a pair of double quotes, and backslashes and new
# lines are represented by the two character sequences \\ and \n,
# respectively.  If the first character of a field is not a double
# quote, then the field is rendered literally, with no backslash
# escapes.
#
# See the ListToWhite, ListToTcl, and ListToCSV procs for exact details
# on the quoting rules.
#
# Examples of data records using the various -structure options are
# provided below.  Note that internally all records are handled as Tcl
# lists, with conversion to the various output structures done on
# output.
#
# The <data type> field is one of the two character sequences "DT",
# "SF", or "VF", indicating data table, scalar field, or vector field
# data, respectively.  The <connection id> field is a unique
# alphanumeric string identifying the source of the data.  This is
# useful in the situation where multiple micromagnetic solvers are
# sending output to one instance of cmdserver.
#
# The format of the data fields depends on the data type.  For
# scalar and vector field servers, the data portion of the 
# record consists of two fields:
#
#      <temp_filename>  <final_filename>
#
# The <temp_filename> field contains the absolute pathname of a file
# that holds the scalar or vector field data, in OVF format.  The
# <final_filename> field holds the intended name for that file.  The
# mmArchive application moves (renames) the OVF file from the first name
# to the second.  The mmDisp application reads the OVF data using the
# first filename, deletes that file, and then bases the file display
# name on the second filename.  The enveloping application using
# cmdserver can make use of this information as it sees fit, but
# regardless it is the responsibility of the enveloping application to
# insure that <temp_filename> is eventually deleted or moved.
#
# As an example, a vector field data record may look like
#
#   D VF _Net_Connection5 /tmp/caesar-28289-0012.ohf /home/julius/Oxs_Demag-Field-00-0000024.ohf
#
# if the configure -structure option is "white" or "tcl".  Alternately,
# if the configure -structure option is "csv" with -csvchar option set
# to ",", then the data record would be
#
#   D,VF,_Net_Connection5,/tmp/caesar-28289-0012.ohf,/home/julius/Oxs_Demag-Field-00-0000024.ohf
#
# Here is a more complicated example, with embedded white space and
# Windows-style (backslashes) directory separators:
#
#   D VF _Net_Connection5 \tmp\caesar-28289-0012.ohf "\\home\\julius caesar\\Oxs_Demag-Field-00-0000024.ohf"
#   D VF _Net_Connection5 {\\tmp\\caesar-28289-0012.ohf} {\\home\\julius caesar\\Oxs_Demag-Field-00-0000024.ohf}
#   D,VF,_Net_Connection5,\tmp\caesar-28289-0012.ohf,\home\julius caesar\Oxs_Demag-Field-00-0000024.ohf
#
# Using "white", "tcl" and "csv" settings for -structure, respectively.
# Note the single backslashes in the fourth field but "\\" in the last
# field of the -structure white line.
#
# The format of the data fields for the data table server consists of
# a list of triples.  The first of these triples has the form
#
#   @Filename:<filename.odt> {} 0
#
# where "<filename.odt>" will be the suggested filename for the output
# file (given as an absolute path).  mmArchive appends the data to this
# file.  The second element here is an empty string, and the third
# element is an unused dummy value.  The rest of the data record
# consists of triples that look like
#
#   "Oxs_RungeKuttaEvolve:evolve:Total energy" J 1.2390938239358198e-15
#
# where the first subfield is the name of the output, the second
# subfield tells the units (here "J" for joules), and the last subfield
# is the numeric value.  The first or second subfields may include
# spaces, in which case quoting is applied as determined by the
# -structure setting.
#
# The data fields are represented as a flat list where the total number
# of data fields is divisible by three.  This means that a data table
# record looks like
#
#   D DT _Net_Connection2 @Filename:/home/julius/oommf/app/oxs/examples/antidots-filled.odt "" 0 "Oxs_RungeKuttaEvolve:evolve:Total energy" J 1.2390938239358198e-15 "Oxs_RungeKuttaEvolve:evolve:Energy calc count" "" 133 "Oxs_RungeKuttaEvolve:evolve:Max dm/dt" deg/ns 2644.8593423271327 Oxs_RungeKuttaEvolve:evolve:dE/dt J/s -4.5119068749840701e-07
#
# for white space delimited records, or
#
#   D DT _Net_Connection2 @Filename:/home/julius/oommf/app/oxs/examples/antidots-filled.odt {} 0 {Oxs_RungeKuttaEvolve:evolve:Total energy} J 1.2390938239358198e-15 {Oxs_RungeKuttaEvolve:evolve:Energy calc count} {} 133 {Oxs_RungeKuttaEvolve:evolve:Max dm/dt} deg/ns 2644.8593423271327 Oxs_RungeKuttaEvolve:evolve:dE/dt J/s -4.5119068749840701e-07
#
# for Tcl-style records.  If the configure -structure option is "csv"
# with -csvchar set to ",", the above data record would be rendered as
#
#   D,DT,_Net_Connection2,@Filename:/home/julius/oommf/app/oxs/examples/antidots-filled.odt,,0,Oxs_RungeKuttaEvolve:evolve:Total energy,J,1.2390938239358198e-15,Oxs_RungeKuttaEvolve:evolve:Energy calc count,,133,Oxs_RungeKuttaEvolve:evolve:Max dm/dt,deg/ns,2644.8593423271327,Oxs_RungeKuttaEvolve:evolve:dE/dt,J/s,-4.5119068749840701e-07
