# START EDIT HERE
# OOMMF software cannot classify your computing platform type.  See
# the Installation section of the OOMMF User Manual for instructions on
# how to add a new platform type to the collection of types recognized
# by OOMMF software.
#
# Say you add the new platform type 'foo' to describe your computing
# platform.  Then copy this file to ./foo.tcl , and edit it to
# describe your computing platform.  In its initial state, this file
# describes a rather generic Linux system, so there shouldn't be much
# editing required for any Unix-based platform.  Other platforms may
# be more difficult or impossible.  In any event, please e-mail the
# OOMMF developers for assistance setting up OOMMF for your particular
# circumstances.
########################################################################
# In order to properly build, install, and run on your computing
# platform, the OOMMF software must know certain features of your
# computing environment.  In this file are lines which set the value of
# certain features of your computing environment.  Each line looks like:
#
# $config SetValue <feature> {<value>}
#
# where each <feature> is the name of some feature of interest,
# and <value> is the value which is assigned to that feature in a
# description of your computing environment.  Your task is to edit
# the values as necessary to properly describe your computing
# environment.
#
# The character '#' at the beginning of a line is a comment character.
# It causes the contents of that line to be ignored.  To select
# among lines providing alternative values for a feature, uncomment the
# line containing the proper value.
#
# The features in this file are divided into three sections.  The
# first section (REQUIRED CONFIGURATION) includes features which
# require you to provide a value.  The second section (LOCAL
# CONFIGURATION) includes features which have usable default values,
# but which you may wish to customize.  These can be edited here, but
# it is recommended instead that you create a subdirectory named
# "local", put a copy of the LOCAL CONFIGURATION section there in a
# file with the same name as this file, and then edit that file.  The
# third section (BUILD CONFIGURATION) contains features which you
# probably do not need or want to change without a good reason.
#
########################################################################
# REQUIRED CONFIGURATION

# Set the feature 'program_compiler_c++' to the program to run on this
# platform to compile source code files written in the language C++ into
# object files.  Select from the choices below.  If the compiler is not
# in your path, be sure to use the whole pathname.  Also include any
# options required to instruct your compiler to only compile, not link.
#
# If your compiler is not listed below, additional features will have
# to be added in the BUILD CONFIGURATION section below to describe to
# the OOMMF software how to operate your compiler.  Send e-mail to the
# OOMMF developers for assistance.

########################################################################
# LOCAL CONFIGURATION
#
# The following options may be defined in the a "local" file, which
# has the same name as this file but is stored in the
# platforms/local/ subdirectory.
#
## Set the feature 'path_directory_temporary' to the name of an existing
## directory on your computer in which OOMMF software should write
## temporary files.  All OOMMF users must have write access to this
## directory.
# $config SetValue path_directory_temporary {/tmp}
#
## Specify whether or not to build in thread support.
## Thread support is included automatically if the tclsh interpreter used
## during the build process is threaded.  If you have a thread enabled
## tclsh, but don't want oommf_threads, override here.
# $config SetValue oommf_threads 0  ;# 1 to force threaded build,
#                                   ## 0 to force non-threaded build.
#
## Specify the number of default threads.  This is only meaningful
## for builds with thread support.
# $config SetValue thread_count 244  ;# Replace '244' with desired thread count.
#
## Specify hard limit on the max number of threads per process.  This is
## only meaningful for builds with thread support.  If not set, then there
## is no limit.
# $config SetValue thread_limit 8
#
## Use NUMA (non-uniform memory access) libraries?  This is only
## supported on Linux systems that have both NUMA runtime (numactl) and
## NUMA development (numactl-devel) packages installed.
# $config SetValue use_numa 1  ;# 1 to enable, 0 (default) to disable.
#
## Override default C++ compiler.  Note the "_override" suffix
## on the value name.
# $config SetValue program_compiler_c++_override {icpc -mmic -c}
#
## Processor architecture for compiling.  The default is "generic"
## which should produce an executable that runs on any cpu model for
## the given platform.  In principle, one may specify "host", in which
## case the build scripts will try to automatically detect the
## processor type on the current system, and select compiler options
## specific to that processor model (in which case he resulting binary
## will generally not run on other architectures) --- HOWEVER, this
## is not supported in the generic "unknown" platform script; support
## would need to be added by the author of a refined platform-specific
## script.
# $config SetValue program_compiler_c++_cpu_arch host
#
## Variable type used for array indices, OC_INDEX.  This is a signed
## type which by default is sized to match the pointer width.  You can
## force the type by setting the following option.  The value should
## be a three item list, where the first item is the name of the
## desired (signed) type, the second item is the name of the
## corresponding unsigned type, and the third is the width of these
## types, in bytes.  It is assumed that both the signed and unsigned
## types are the same width, as otherwise significant code breakage is
## expected.  Example:
# $config SetValue program_compiler_c++_oc_index_type {int {unsigned int} 4}
#
## For OC_INDEX type checks.  If set to 1, then various segments in
## the code are activated which will detect some array index type
## mismatches at link time.  These tests are not comprehensive, and
## will probably break most third party code, but may be useful during
## development testing.
# $config SetValue program_compiler_c++_oc_index_checks 1
#
## Flags to remove from compiler "opts" string:
# $config SetValue program_compiler_c++_remove_flags \
#                          {-fomit-frame-pointer -fprefetch-loop-arrays}
#
## Flags to add to compiler "opts" string:
# $config SetValue program_compiler_c++_add_flags \
#                          {-funroll-loops}
#
## Cross-compiling support:
##
## Part of the OOMMF build process involves building a test program
## (e.g., oommf/pkg/oc/varinfo.cc), and then running it to determine
## properties of the target platform.  This is complicated, however, when
## cross-compiling because the executable doesn't run on the host doing
## the build.  To work around this, the cross_compile_exec property
## specifies a command (typically ssh) that can be invoked in place of a
## direct exec call.  If using ssh, then you probably want a key agent
## running so that the exec call runs without prompting for passwords.
# $config SetValue cross_compile_exec {ssh target}
#
## If the target machine sees the OOMMF executables at some point in its
## filesystem, then cross_compile_path_to_oommf can be used to direct
## executable file access.
# $config SetValue cross_compile_path_to_oommf {/home/jones/oommf}
#
# System type (typically $tcl_platform(platform) on target machine)
# $config SetValue cross_compile_systemtype unix
#
## tclConfig.sh, tkConfig.sh and include files for the target are needed
## for the build.  These files must exist on the host; the following
## variables specify the paths *on the build host* to these files.
# $config SetValue cross_compile_host_tcl_config {/home/jones/tcl/lib/tclConfig.sh}
# $config SetValue cross_compile_host_tcl_include_dir {/home/jones/tcl/include}
# $config SetValue cross_compile_host_tk_config {/home/jones/tcl/lib/tkConfig.sh}
# $config SetValue cross_compile_host_tk_include_dir {/home/jones/tcl/include}
#
## If the Tcl install on the target does not place the Tcl library in
## one of the standard search places for the run-time linker, then specify
## the Tcl library directory (on the target) here.
# $config SetValue cross_compile_target_tcl_rpath {/home/smith/tcl/lib}
#
## If the tclConfig.sh doesn't have the proper target-side path for
## TCL_PREFIX, then set cross_compiler_target_tcl_library to the path
## *on the target system* to the directory holding the init.tcl file
## (typically ${TCL_PREFIX}/lib/tcl${TCL_VERSION}).
# $config SetValue cross_compile_target_tcl_library /home/smith/tcl/lib/tcl8.6
