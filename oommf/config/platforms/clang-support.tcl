# A couple of Tcl procs for use determining compiler options for clang:
#    GuessClangVersion
# which runs clang++ to guess the version of Clang being used.
#    GetClangGeneralOptFlags
# which returns a list of aggressive, non-processor-specific
# optimization flags that can be passed to clang, and
#    GetClangCpuOptFlags
# which returns a list of aggressive, processor-specific
# optimization flags for clang.
#

# Routine to guess the Clang version.  The import, clang, is used via "exec
# $clangc --version" (or, rather, the "open" analogue) to determine the
# clang version (useful for whene the flags accepted by clang vary by version).
# Return value is the clang version string as a list of numbers,
# for example, {3 1} for version 3.1.

   # -fomit-frame-pointer causes problems with exception handling
   # through class constructors, and apparently some problems with the
   # map STL container.  So just leave it out, for now.
