## About

This is a repository of the [OOMMF](https://math.nist.gov/oommf/oommf.html) software. It holds the OOMMF source files as distributed by [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/) available [here](https://math.nist.gov/oommf/software-20.html) in the [oommf](oommf) subdirectory of this repository.

The intention is to provide the OOMMF distribution files in a git repository for those who prefer to pull them via git.

In addition to the OOMMF source code that is offered from NIST (and the OOMMF
extension coming from NIST), this repository contains some additional
user-contributed extensions. Those can be seen from the [Makefile-update-oommf](Makefile-update-oommf). See also [Extensions](#Extensions) below.

Compilation of OOMMF (for example by running `make build`) is expected 
to work on Linux and OS X.

## Version

The current version of OOMMF code in this repository is the alpha release of OOMMF 2.0 (`20a0 20170929 a0`). 

You can check which version you have, by inspecting the content of the [oommf-version](oommf-version) file. 

The history of all OOMMF versions hosted in this directory is provided in [versionlog.txt](versionlog.txt).



## Clone and build

If you want to build OOMMF from source, clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/fangohr/oommf.git

and build it

    make build


A number of OOMMF extensions come with the source. Some of those are packaged by the OOMMF authors (Mike Donahue et al) at NIST together with the OOMMF source. Some (see section [Extensions](#Extensions)) have been added to this repository. 

All extension files are at this location [oommf/app/oxs/local](https://github.com/fangohr/oommf/tree/master/oommf/app/oxs/local) in the source code.

## Smoke test

You can compute standard problems 3 and 4 as a test of your build by running:

    make test-all


## Extensions

A number of OOMMF extensions are included:

We provide Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction extensions for three different crystallographic classes:

1. C<sub>nv</sub> - interfacial DMI ([repository](https://github.com/joommf/oommf-extension-dmi-cnv)),
2. T(O) - bulk DMI ([repository](https://github.com/joommf/oommf-extension-dmi-t)), and
3. D<sub>2d</sub> - antiskyrmion DMI ([repository](https://github.com/joommf/oommf-extension-dmi-d2d))

And 

- the OOMMF Magnetoelastic Extension Module (https://github.com/yuyahagi/oommf-mel) from Yu Yahagi.


## Docker

In [`docker/`](docker/) directory we provide [Dockerfile](docker/Dockerfile) and [Makefile](docker/Makefile) for building and running Docker images containg OOMMF. In addition, we also provide pre-built image at DockerHub under [`ubermag/oommf`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ubermag/oommf/) repository. More information about Docker as well as on how to install it on your system can be found [here](https://www.docker.com/).

### Getting the image

If you want to build an image yourself, navigate to the `docker/` directory and run

    make build

This command builds the image under the `ubermag/oommf:latest` name. Otherwise, you can obtain the most recent image by pulling it from DockerHub [`ubermag/oommf`](https://hub.docker.com/r/joommf/oommf/) repository

    docker pull ubermag/oommf

### Running the container

To run a container, navigate to `docker/` directory and run

    make run
    
Or you can type the full command yourself:

	docker run --rm -ti -v `pwd`:/io ubermag/oommf:latest bash

Once inside the container, the `oommf.tcl` file is in `/usr/local/oommf/oommf/oommf.tcl`. For convenience, we provide a shell script `oommf` in the search path (in `/usr/local/bin`). This can be used, for example:

    oommfuser@715477218aac:/io# oommf +version
    <23> oommf.tcl 1.2.0.6  info:
    oommf.tcl 1.2.0.6

In addition, during the build process, we also set an environment variable `OOMMFTCL` to point to the `/usr/local/oommf/oommf/oommf.tcl` file. 

There is also the `OOMMF_ROOT` variable which points to the base directory
of the OOMMF sources (that's currently `/usr/local/oommf/oommf`). It can be used, for example, to execute an OOMMF example:

    oommf boxsi +fg $OOMMF_ROOT/app/oxs/examples/stdprob3.mif -exitondone 1

### No graphical user interface

Please note that OOMMF's graphical user interface (GUI) in Docker container cannot be used (without further work), but it can be used to execute `.mif` files, through `boxsi`, for example:

    root@715477218aac:/io# oommf boxsi
    
## Conda

We also made recipes for building [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/) OOMMF package and they are available [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/oommf-feedstock). Information on how to install Conda on your system as well as how to use it can be found [here](https://conda.io/docs/). Installing `oommf` [package](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/oommf) using conda can be done by running

    conda install -c conda-forge oommf

## Support
